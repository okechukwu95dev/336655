Extract betting picks from this soccer tipster transcript.

For each pick, capture:
1. Match (Team A vs Team B) - MUST be specific team names, not placeholders
2. Pick - MUST be specific (e.g., "Over 2.5 goals", "BTTS Yes", "Liverpool ML", "Salah over 1.5 shots")
3. Odds (if mentioned)
4. Tipster name
5. Reasons - dimension name + their exact words

TIPSTER IDENTIFICATION:
- PickDawgz videos have multiple hosts: Kirk, Goran, Jack, Ashley, Eric
- Listen for "I'll take", "I like", "Give me" to identify who makes each pick
- Maikito/Makito is solo - use "Maikito" as tipster name
- Matt English videos: use "Matt" or "Ben" based on who speaks
- If unclear, use null

DIMENSION NAMING:
Use descriptive names. Common patterns:
- home_form, away_form (team's recent results at home/away)
- home_defense_weak, away_defense_weak (conceding goals)  
- home_offense_strong, away_offense_strong (scoring goals)
- h2h_goals (history between these teams has goals)
- h2h_tight (history is low-scoring/cagey)
- injuries_key_player (missing important player)
- motivation_title_race, motivation_relegation, motivation_europe (what they're playing for)
- fixture_congestion (many games, tired legs)
- value_odds (price is good)
- derby (rivalry match)
- form_winning_streak, form_losing_streak
- player_scoring_form (specific player on hot streak)
- opponent_weak_vs_type (e.g., "struggles against top teams")

Avoid overusing generic dimensions. Be specific:
- BAD: "away_defense_weak" for everything
- GOOD: "conceding_1.5_goals_per_game_away", "no_clean_sheets_in_6"

RULES:
- Skip picks where match teams aren't clearly named
- Skip "stay away" or "I'm not touching" - those aren't picks
- Player props MUST include player name and specific line (e.g., "Salah over 1.5 shots", not just "player prop")
- Quote 10-30 words of their actual reasoning
- One dimension per distinct reason - don't lump multiple ideas together
